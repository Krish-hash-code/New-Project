Because journalists love America and America was attacked last year and America s probably going to be attacked again next year around the midterms, and you call it a hoax,  Stetler said. And that has what to do with our campaign that I managed? I managed that winning campaign,  Conway demanded.  It has what to do with that campaign? That may be because by the time you became campaign manager, the deal was already in, the conversations were already had. We don t know, Kellyanne, but shouldn t we find out?  Stelter replied. Are you actually alleging there was active conversations with Russians trying to change the election results?  Conway raved.  Because very few people are saying that. Are you saying that or just trying to put it out there because you guys are so invested? What is there? What constitutional crisis are we facing right now? I ll leave that to [CNN s] Jeffrey Toobin and the law expert  Stelter said, demanding to know why Trump doesn t want answers as much as the rest of Americans. Isn t Mr. Mueller and his band of democratic donors trying to do that?  Conway shot back, adding that Americans would rather hear about Trump s propaganda than the  unequal coverage on Russia. Watch the interview below:\",\n          \"Target stores are living up to their name by being the literal  target  of anti-LGBT, transphobic bigots and professionally-offended  Christians,  who are now showing up at their locations across the country. Their intent, it seems, is to frighten patrons into being afraid to use the bathroom. Walking up and down the aisles, and wearing shirts depicting stick figures having sex, they shout and scream about how God is the new judge of retail merchandise as they try to convince people the women s restrooms are loaded with perverts.Below are some videos taken in target stores, showing the  preachers  rebuking people for going to the bathroom. Target this is your wake up call. The Bible says that from the beginning God made them male and female. He didn t make them transvestites. He made them male and female Target, this is your warning. You will be judged according to God s standards. Not man s, but God s You need to repent You will be judged. And if there are Christians in here, supporting this abomination, shame on you!   But you justify this place. You have to stand by the bathrooms because perverts can go in there. Because transvestites allowed. Apparently, God can create a universe in 6 days but can t deal with the idea of someone peeing in a bathroom in a department store.One of these God Warriors, Michael Merichko, was charged with disorderly conduct following a disturbance inside a Target store in Illinois. His obnoxiousness, coupled with the fact he was an unhinged white guy, convinced an entire shopping mall to go on lockdown because they thought he was an active shooter.via towleroadLuckily he was not, but frankly it isn t a stretch to think that some unhinged individual will eventually walk into a Target store and start shooting because God told them it was a good idea.Below is another religious idiot in St. Louis who is too obsessed with the idea of people peeing for his own good.Part 1: Part 2: The Republican party can be thanked for this. If it wasn t for people like Ted Cruz using religion as a justification for hatred, Target would never have had to make a  bathroom policy.  Transgender people have been using public restrooms forever without God destroying the planet as a result. It took Republicans to make it a sudden problem for him.Featured image via video screen capture\",\n          \"Ha! PBS had a live feed on Facebook for the  Democratic Woman of the Year Award  but it didn t go as planned because the comments were overwhelmingly negative. PBS finally announced they were shutting down the live feed on Facebook and moving it over to YouTube where they conveniently disabled comments. LOL!Comments below the PBS announcement on Facebook were 99% against PBS airing anything to do with Hillary Clinton. To put it mildly, people were ticked off that PBS was airing this on their Facebook live feed: The comments from the  Facebook newsfeed are priceless some of the best we ve ever read.

The proposed legislation would use the $18 billion to halt cuts to the size of the military and boost training and maintenance in an effort to improve U.S. military readiness. The funding shift would leave $35.7 billion to pay for U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The House panel said that was enough to last through April 2017, giving the next president time to evaluate the security situation and make a supplemental budget request to Congress. Representative Madeleine Bordallo, a Democrat from Guam, said she was \\u201cconcerned that the short-sighted budget gimmick ... may leave our troops short of funding required in the near future.\\u201d But Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the committee, said that while \\u201csome people may call it a gimmick,\\u201d the Democratic majority in 2008 had done something very similar. The U.S. military has warned repeatedly in recent years that ongoing efforts to trim nearly $1 trillion from projected defense budgets over a decade have forced it to postpone training, maintenance and upkeep. The measure, the National Defense Authorization Act, sets U.S. defense policy and authorizes, but does not appropriate, funding for the Pentagon. Lawmakers in the House panel expected to vote on the final version early on Thursday, after which it will go to the full House of Representatives. The draft bill unveiled by Thornberry this week would authorize $610.5 billion in defense spending for the 2017 fiscal year beginning in October. That total is in line with the defense spending plan proposed by Obama earlier this year. The proposal calls for an active duty Army of 480,000 troops, which is 20,000 more than proposed in the president\\u2019s budget request. It also seeks significant reforms in the organization of the Defense Department, including expanding the term and the advisory role of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. During debates on the legislation, lawmakers approved an amendment that calls for a senior U.S. defense official to be placed in charge of developing directed energy weapons. The U.S. military hopes directed-energy weapons will provide it with an asymmetric advantage over potential rivals, for example enabling it to counter million-dollar missiles with a weapon that fires projectiles costing only $25,000. \",\n          \"French unions block fuel depots in protest against labor reforms PARIS (Reuters) - French trade unionists blocked access on Monday to several fuel depots in protest against an overhaul of employment laws, seeking to test the government s will to reform the economy. In southern France, protesters  unions set up a road-block in front of Total s La Mede refinery, while in western France fuel depots were blocked near Bordeaux and the coastal city of La Rochelle. Union members also held go-slow operations on highways near Paris and in northern France.  We re determined. We re going to stay as long as possible while hoping that other blockades take place elsewhere, maybe that ll make Mr. Macron move,  Force Ouvriere union official Pascal Favre told Reuters. Eager to avoid fuel shortages, centrist President Emmanuel Macron s government deployed police at some sites before dawn to ensure by force that protesters could not block access.   It s not in blockading the country s economy and by preventing people from working, that one best defends one s cause,  junior economy minister Benjamin Griveaux told RTL radio. The labor reform is due to become law in the coming days after Macron formally signed five labor form decrees on Friday, in the first major economic reforms since he took power in May. The new rules, discussed at length in advance with unions, will cap payouts on dismissals that are judged unfair, while also giving companies greater freedom to hire and fire employees and to agree working conditions. While unions have failed to derail the reform, the considerable political capital Macron had after his landslide election victory in May is quickly evaporating. Macron suffered his first electoral setback on Sunday when his Republic on the Move (LREM) party won fewer seats than expected in elections for the French Senate. \",\n          \"REPORT: Americans With Six Figure Incomes Living in Government Housing Government waste and abuse runs rampant but this is maddening! The people who receive government housing are checked out in the beginning but then not after the first year. What kind of system is that? We have people making six figures living in government housing??? Unreal! HERE S AN EXAMPLE FROM ALABAMA:MOBILE, Ala.   A report by the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development revealed this week that thousands of families across the country living in public housing are  overincome,  or making more income than qualifies them for taxpayer subsidized housing, including more than 800 in Alabama.According to the Department s report,  Public housing authorities provided public housing assistance to as many as 25,226 families whose income exceeded HUD s 2014 eligibility income limits. Of these 25,226 families, 17,761 had earned more than the qualifying amount for more than 1 year. HUD, however, only requires residents to prove their income falls under the income limit when they move into the housing, but not after. In 2004 the Department gave discretion to local public housing authorities whether or not they would enforce the income limits after a resident had moved in. The 15 housing authorities that [HUD] contacted choose to allow overincome families to reside in public housing. HUD did not encourage them to require overincome families to find housing in the unassisted market. In Alabama the report found 812 cases of these so-called  overincome  families and individuals living in subsidized housing.While some of the families overincome only exceeded the limit, which differs based on the location and size of family, by a few hundred dollars, others made tens of thousands. One case in Crenshaw County revealed a family income of $153,016 more than $119,000 over the limit.In all, there were 6 Alabama families or individuals found who have an annual income of more than $100,000 still living in taxpayer funded housing. I make minimum wage, and I wish I did make enough money to get my family out,  Mobile public housing resident Todrick Davis told WPMI.As a result of these overincome residents, the report states,  HUD did not assist as many low-income families in need of housing as it could have. In fact, the Inspector General concluded, HUD will pay $104.4 million over the next year for public housing units occupied by overincome families that otherwise could have been used to house low-income families.Via: Yellow Hammer\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Because journalists love America and America was attacked last year and America s probably going to be attacked again next year around the midterms, and you call it a hoax,  Stetler said. And that has what to do with our campaign that I managed? I managed that winning campaign,  Conway demanded.  It has what to do with that campaign? That may be because by the time you became campaign manager, the deal was already in, the conversations were already had. We don t know, Kellyanne, but shouldn t we find out?  Stelter replied. Are you actually alleging there was active conversations with Russians trying to change the election results?  Conway raved.  Because very few people are saying that. Are you saying that or just trying to put it out there because you guys are so invested? What is there? What constitutional crisis are we facing right now? I ll leave that to [CNN s] Jeffrey Toobin and the law expert  Stelter said, demanding to know why Trump doesn t want answers as much as the rest of Americans. Isn t Mr. Mueller and his band of democratic donors trying to do that?  Conway shot back, adding that Americans would rather hear about Trump s propaganda than the  unequal coverage on Russia. Watch the interview below:\",\n          \"Target stores are living up to their name by being the literal  target  of anti-LGBT, transphobic bigots and professionally-offended  Christians,  who are now showing up at their locations across the country. Their intent, it seems, is to frighten patrons into being afraid to use the bathroom. Walking up and down the aisles, and wearing shirts depicting stick figures having sex, they shout and scream about how God is the new judge of retail merchandise as they try to convince people the women s restrooms are loaded with perverts.Below are some videos taken in target stores, showing the  preachers  rebuking people for going to the bathroom. Target this is your wake up call. The Bible says that from the beginning God made them male and female. He didn t make them transvestites. He made them male and female Target, this is your warning. You will be judged according to God s standards. Not man s, but God s You need to repent You will be judged. And if there are Christians in here, supporting this abomination, shame on you!   But you justify this place. You have to stand by the bathrooms because perverts can go in there. Because transvestites allowed. Apparently, God can create a universe in 6 days but can t deal with the idea of someone peeing in a bathroom in a department store.One of these God Warriors, Michael Merichko, was charged with disorderly conduct following a disturbance inside a Target store in Illinois. His obnoxiousness, coupled with the fact he was an unhinged white guy, convinced an entire shopping mall to go on lockdown because they thought he was an active shooter.via towleroadLuckily he was not, but frankly it isn t a stretch to think that some unhinged individual will eventually walk into a Target store and start shooting because God told them it was a good idea.Below is another religious idiot in St. Louis who is too obsessed with the idea of people peeing for his own good.Part 1: Part 2: The Republican party can be thanked for this. If it wasn t for people like Ted Cruz using religion as a justification for hatred, Target would never have had to make a  bathroom policy.  Transgender people have been using public restrooms forever without God destroying the planet as a result. It took Republicans to make it a sudden problem for him.Featured image via video screen capture\",\n          \"Ha!

The proposed legislation would use the $18 billion to halt cuts to the size of the military and boost training and maintenance in an effort to improve U.S. military readiness. The funding shift would leave $35.7 billion to pay for U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The House panel said that was enough to last through April 2017, giving the next president time to evaluate the security situation and make a supplemental budget request to Congress. Representative Madeleine Bordallo, a Democrat from Guam, said she was \\u201cconcerned that the short-sighted budget gimmick ... may leave our troops short of funding required in the near future.\\u201d But Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the committee, said that while \\u201csome people may call it a gimmick,\\u201d the Democratic majority in 2008 had done something very similar. The U.S. military has warned repeatedly in recent years that ongoing efforts to trim nearly $1 trillion from projected defense budgets over a decade have forced it to postpone training, maintenance and upkeep. The measure, the National Defense Authorization Act, sets U.S. defense policy and authorizes, but does not appropriate, funding for the Pentagon. Lawmakers in the House panel expected to vote on the final version early on Thursday, after which it will go to the full House of Representatives. The draft bill unveiled by Thornberry this week would authorize $610.5 billion in defense spending for the 2017 fiscal year beginning in October. That total is in line with the defense spending plan proposed by Obama earlier this year. The proposal calls for an active duty Army of 480,000 troops, which is 20,000 more than proposed in the president\\u2019s budget request. It also seeks significant reforms in the organization of the Defense Department, including expanding the term and the advisory role of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. During debates on the legislation, lawmakers approved an amendment that calls for a senior U.S. defense official to be placed in charge of developing directed energy weapons. The U.S. military hopes directed-energy weapons will provide it with an asymmetric advantage over potential rivals, for example enabling it to counter million-dollar missiles with a weapon that fires projectiles costing only $25,000. \",\n          \"PARIS (Reuters) - French trade unionists blocked access on Monday to several fuel depots in protest against an overhaul of employment laws, seeking to test the government s will to reform the economy. In southern France, protesters  unions set up a road-block in front of Total s La Mede refinery, while in western France fuel depots were blocked near Bordeaux and the coastal city of La Rochelle. Union members also held go-slow operations on highways near Paris and in northern France.  We re determined. We re going to stay as long as possible while hoping that other blockades take place elsewhere, maybe that ll make Mr. Macron move,  Force Ouvriere union official Pascal Favre told Reuters. Eager to avoid fuel shortages, centrist President Emmanuel Macron s government deployed police at some sites before dawn to ensure by force that protesters could not block access.   It s not in blockading the country s economy and by preventing people from working, that one best defends one s cause,  junior economy minister Benjamin Griveaux told RTL radio. The labor reform is due to become law in the coming days after Macron formally signed five labor form decrees on Friday, in the first major economic reforms since he took power in May. The new rules, discussed at length in advance with unions, will cap payouts on dismissals that are judged unfair, while also giving companies greater freedom to hire and fire employees and to agree working conditions. While unions have failed to derail the reform, the considerable political capital Macron had after his landslide election victory in May is quickly evaporating. Macron suffered his first electoral setback on Sunday when his Republic on the Move (LREM) party won fewer seats than expected in elections for the French Senate. \",\n          \"Government waste and abuse runs rampant but this is maddening! The people who receive government housing are checked out in the beginning but then not after the first year. What kind of system is that? We have people making six figures living in government housing??? Unreal! HERE S AN EXAMPLE FROM ALABAMA:MOBILE, Ala.   A report by the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development revealed this week that thousands of families across the country living in public housing are  overincome,  or making more income than qualifies them for taxpayer subsidized housing, including more than 800 in Alabama.According to the Department s report,  Public housing authorities provided public housing assistance to as many as 25,226 families whose income exceeded HUD s 2014 eligibility income limits. Of these 25,226 families, 17,761 had earned more than the qualifying amount for more than 1 year. HUD, however, only requires residents to prove their income falls under the income limit when they move into the housing, but not after. In 2004 the Department gave discretion to local public housing authorities whether or not they would enforce the income limits after a resident had moved in. The 15 housing authorities that [HUD] contacted choose to allow overincome families to reside in public housing. HUD did not encourage them to require overincome families to find housing in the unassisted market. In Alabama the report found 812 cases of these so-called  overincome  families and individuals living in subsidized housing.While some of the families overincome only exceeded the limit, which differs based on the location and size of family, by a few hundred dollars, others made tens of thousands. One case in Crenshaw County revealed a family income of $153,016 more than $119,000 over the limit.In all, there were 6 Alabama families or individuals found who have an annual income of more than $100,000 still living in taxpayer funded housing. I make minimum wage, and I wish I did make enough money to get my family out,  Mobile public housing resident Todrick Davis told WPMI.As a result of these overincome residents, the report states,  HUD did not assist as many low-income families in need of housing as it could have. In fact, the Inspector General concluded, HUD will pay $104.4 million over the next year for public housing units occupied by overincome families that otherwise could have been used to house low-income families.Via: Yellow Hammer\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_text\",\n      \"properties\":

A spokeswoman for Grassley said that the Republican senator spoke with Garland late on Monday and extended the invitation \\u201cwhere they could discuss the nomination and why the Senate will not consider a nominee until the next president takes office.\\u201d The Senate Judiciary Committee is in charge of holding hearings on Supreme Court nominees chosen by the president and deciding whether to recommend full Senate confirmation. Most of the Senate\\u2019s 54 Republicans have indicated opposition to confirming any high-court nominee of Obama\\u2019s, saying the choice should be made by the next president, who would be elected on Nov. 8 and sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. Despite the wall of Republican opposition to Garland, who is considered a moderate federal appeals court judge, Obama and his fellow Democrats continue to push for Senate confirmation this year. Garland already has made several \\u201ccourtesy calls\\u201d to senators, mostly Democrats, and will continue his visits to Capitol Hill this week. If he were to be confirmed, Garland - nominated to fill the vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia - would tilt the Supreme Court to the left for the first time in decades. The race for a replacement for Obama, who is completing his second and final term as president, is in full swing now with billionaire businessman Donald Trump leading two other Republican candidates and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. But it could be weeks or months before the two political parties settle on their respective candidates. A date for the breakfast meeting has not yet been set, Grassley\\u2019s spokeswoman said.\",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The email Donald Trump\\u2019s campaign sent inviting fans to a rally next week looked familiar: \\u201cMeet me in New Jersey!\\u201d it urged. But something was different. \\u201cYou will need to buy a ticket to get into the rally,\\u201d it added. The cost: $200. During the months-long battle for the Republican presidential nomination, rallies staged by Trump, the party\\u2019s likely candidate in the Nov. 8 election, were free and open to anyone with the stamina to withstand half a day\\u2019s wait outside and a heady hour packed into a sports stadium or warehouse. Supporters could buy snacks or hats or T-shirts while they waited, but they never had to pay for admission. The May 19 rally advertised in the email is a fundraiser for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former presidential rival now working for Trump who, according to news reports, needs to retire debt from his own failed campaign. The emailed invitation to supporters said it will be a fundraiser. It was not clear whether Trump will charge for rallies that are not specifically designated as fundraisers.  The New York billionaire has claimed he was self-funding his campaign and did not need donations. He has financed his offensive in the nominating phase of the race for the White House with loans to himself as well as around $12 million in unsolicited donations from fans. Now that Trump is pivoting toward the general election, where conventional estimates put the cost of winning at around $1 billion, things are changing.  The move to charge admission for some appearances was just one harbinger of a new relationship between Trump and his fans, many of whom cited their perception of his financial independence as a major factor behind their support. It will test the loyalty of those who have swelled his rallies to capacity, either transforming huge crowds into cash cows or creating more breathing room in the places where he appears.      When asked whether the format of the Christie fundraiser rally would be repeated in the future, Trump\\u2019s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not comment. \\u201cThis is a fundraiser for Governor Christie,\\u201d she said. Supporters have said Trump\\u2019s about-face on fundraising does not bother them. Susan Kihne, a Mandan, North Dakota resident who snagged a ticket to see Trump speak at a petroleum conference later this month decided the $30 it cost her was worth it. \\u201cHe\\u2019s self-funded up until now, so I don\\u2019t mind supporting him,\\u201d she said. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. senators on Monday sharpened a potential line of attack against Neil Gorsuch\\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court by questioning whether he would be sufficiently independent as a justice in light of President Donald Trump\\u2019s vigorous use of unilateral presidential power including his travel ban. Their comments came after Trump criticized James Robart, the U.S. district court judge who put on hold the Republican president\\u2019s Jan. 27 order temporarily barring entry into the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority nations and halting the U.S. refugee program. Trump called Robart a \\u201cso-called judge\\u201d who made a \\u201cridiculous\\u201d decision. Democrats have expressed worry that Gorsuch, nominated by Trump last week, could act as a rubber stamp for the Republican president\\u2019s policies on a nine-seat Supreme Court poised to revert to a conservative majority.  \\u201cIt\\u2019s a serious concern with a president who attacks the judiciary and seems to not respect the rule of law and the Constitution that you have a really independent justice,\\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, set to meet with Gorsuch on Tuesday, told Reuters. Gorsuch, continuing a series of private meetings with senators ahead of his Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, met on Monday with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the panel\\u2019s top Democrat, at her Senate office. Afterward, she said Gorsuch is \\u201cclearly very smart, caring, and he\\u2019s well thought of in Colorado,\\u201d where he serves as a federal appeals court judge. But Feinstein said she will make up her mind after the hearing about whether or not to support his confirmation. \\u201cWhat we would like to see is an independent judge, and the hearing will determine that,\\u201d Feinstein told Reuters. Gorsuch must be confirmed by the Senate to the lifetime post on the high court. \\u201cIt\\u2019s incumbent upon Judge Gorsuch to make it clear to the American people that he does not believe in \\u2018so-called judges,\\u2019 that he thinks it\\u2019s imperative that the judiciary has to be respected as an independent one-third of our government,\\u201d     said Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year. \\u201cI would look forward to hearing him speak out on that issue,\\u201d Sanders added. Conservative lawyers and Republican senators who are favorable toward Gorsuch cite his record of supporting limited federal powers and his skepticism about courts deferring too much to executive branch interpretations of the law when issuing regulations as signs he would be willing to stand up to Trump. \\u201cI have zero concerns about his independence being compromised,\\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee. Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker, another Republican, said Gorsuch \\u201chas a trail of decisions and publications a mile long that suggest how talented he is, that are instructive as to how he would rule on any number of issues.\\u201d  With four liberals and four conservatives now on the court, Gorsuch\\u2019s confirmation would restore the conservative majority that had existed for decades until the death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch\\u2019s supporters point in particular to a recent case in which Gorsuch criticized a landmark high court ruling known as Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. That 1984 ruling directed judges nationwide to defer to federal agencies\\u2019 interpretation of laws that may be ambiguous. Gorsuch in a concurring opinion called that doctrine the \\u201celephant in the room\\u201d that concentrates federal power \\u201cin a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution.\\u201d If Gorsuch is confirmed to serve on a court that would have five conservatives and four liberals, Democrats have expressed concern about setbacks for their positions on divisive issues such as abortion, gun control, environmental regulation and transgender rights. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2377,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jul 25, 2017\",\n          \"Jul 23, 2016\",\n          \"April 12, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A spokeswoman for Grassley said that the Republican senator spoke with Garland late on Monday and extended the invitation \\u201cwhere they could discuss the nomination and why the Senate will not consider a nominee until the next president takes office.\\u201d The Senate Judiciary Committee is in charge of holding hearings on Supreme Court nominees chosen by the president and deciding whether to recommend full Senate confirmation. Most of the Senate\\u2019s 54 Republicans have indicated opposition to confirming any high-court nominee of Obama\\u2019s, saying the choice should be made by the next president, who would be elected on Nov. 8 and sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. Despite the wall of Republican opposition to Garland, who is considered a moderate federal appeals court judge, Obama and his fellow Democrats continue to push for Senate confirmation this year. Garland already has made several \\u201ccourtesy calls\\u201d to senators, mostly Democrats, and will continue his visits to Capitol Hill this week. If he were to be confirmed, Garland - nominated to fill the vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia - would tilt the Supreme Court to the left for the first time in decades. The race for a replacement for Obama, who is completing his second and final term as president, is in full swing now with billionaire businessman Donald Trump leading two other Republican candidates and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. But it could be weeks or months before the two political parties settle on their respective candidates. A date for the breakfast meeting has not yet been set, Grassley\\u2019s spokeswoman said.\",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The email Donald Trump\\u2019s campaign sent inviting fans to a rally next week looked familiar: \\u201cMeet me in New Jersey!\\u201d it urged. But something was different. \\u201cYou will need to buy a ticket to get into the rally,\\u201d it added. The cost: $200. During the months-long battle for the Republican presidential nomination, rallies staged by Trump, the party\\u2019s likely candidate in the Nov. 8 election, were free and open to anyone with the stamina to withstand half a day\\u2019s wait outside and a heady hour packed into a sports stadium or warehouse. Supporters could buy snacks or hats or T-shirts while they waited, but they never had to pay for admission. The May 19 rally advertised in the email is a fundraiser for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former presidential rival now working for Trump who, according to news reports, needs to retire debt from his own failed campaign. The emailed invitation to supporters said it will be a fundraiser. It was not clear whether Trump will charge for rallies that are not specifically designated as fundraisers.  The New York billionaire has claimed he was self-funding his campaign and did not need donations. He has financed his offensive in the nominating phase of the race for the White House with loans to himself as well as around $12 million in unsolicited donations from fans. Now that Trump is pivoting toward the general election, where conventional estimates put the cost of winning at around $1 billion, things are changing.  The move to charge admission for some appearances was just one harbinger of a new relationship between Trump and his fans, many of whom cited their perception of his financial independence as a major factor behind their support. It will test the loyalty of those who have swelled his rallies to capacity, either transforming huge crowds into cash cows or creating more breathing room in the places where he appears.      When asked whether the format of the Christie fundraiser rally would be repeated in the future, Trump\\u2019s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not comment. \\u201cThis is a fundraiser for Governor Christie,\\u201d she said. Supporters have said Trump\\u2019s about-face on fundraising does not bother them. Susan Kihne, a Mandan, North Dakota resident who snagged a ticket to see Trump speak at a petroleum conference later this month decided the $30 it cost her was worth it. \\u201cHe\\u2019s self-funded up until now, so I don\\u2019t mind supporting him,\\u201d she said. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. senators on Monday sharpened a potential line of attack against Neil Gorsuch\\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court by questioning whether he would be sufficiently independent as a justice in light of President Donald Trump\\u2019s vigorous use of unilateral presidential power including his travel ban. Their comments came after Trump criticized James Robart, the U.S. district court judge who put on hold the Republican president\\u2019s Jan. 27 order temporarily barring entry into the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority nations and halting the U.S. refugee program. Trump called Robart a \\u201cso-called judge\\u201d who made a \\u201cridiculous\\u201d decision. Democrats have expressed worry that Gorsuch, nominated by Trump last week, could act as a rubber stamp for the Republican president\\u2019s policies on a nine-seat Supreme Court poised to revert to a conservative majority.  \\u201cIt\\u2019s a serious concern with a president who attacks the judiciary and seems to not respect the rule of law and the Constitution that you have a really independent justice,\\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, set to meet with Gorsuch on Tuesday, told Reuters. Gorsuch, continuing a series of private meetings with senators ahead of his Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, met on Monday with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the panel\\u2019s top Democrat, at her Senate office. Afterward, she said Gorsuch is \\u201cclearly very smart, caring, and he\\u2019s well thought of in Colorado,\\u201d where he serves as a federal appeals court judge. But Feinstein said she will make up her mind after the hearing about whether or not to support his confirmation. \\u201cWhat we would like to see is an independent judge, and the hearing will determine that,\\u201d Feinstein told Reuters. Gorsuch must be confirmed by the Senate to the lifetime post on the high court. \\u201cIt\\u2019s incumbent upon Judge Gorsuch to make it clear to the American people that he does not believe in \\u2018so-called judges,\\u2019 that he thinks it\\u2019s imperative that the judiciary has to be respected as an independent one-third of our government,\\u201d     said Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year. \\u201cI would look forward to hearing him speak out on that issue,\\u201d Sanders added. Conservative lawyers and Republican senators who are favorable toward Gorsuch cite his record of supporting limited federal powers and his skepticism about courts deferring too much to executive branch interpretations of the law when issuing regulations as signs he would be willing to stand up to Trump. \\u201cI have zero concerns about his independence being compromised,\\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee. Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker, another Republican, said Gorsuch \\u201chas a trail of decisions and publications a mile long that suggest how talented he is, that are instructive as to how he would rule on any number of issues.\\u201d  With four liberals and four conservatives now on the court, Gorsuch\\u2019s confirmation would restore the conservative majority that had existed for decades until the death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch\\u2019s supporters point in particular to a recent case in which Gorsuch criticized a landmark high court ruling known as Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. That 1984 ruling directed judges nationwide to defer to federal agencies\\u2019 interpretation of laws that may be ambiguous. Gorsuch in a concurring opinion called that doctrine the \\u201celephant in the room\\u201d that concentrates federal power \\u201cin a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution.\\u201d If Gorsuch is confirmed to serve on a court that would have five conservatives and four liberals, Democrats have expressed concern about setbacks for their positions on divisive issues such as abortion, gun control, environmental regulation and transgender rights. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2377,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jul 25, 2017\",\n          \"Jul 23, 2016\",\n          \"April 12, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A spokeswoman for Grassley said that the Republican senator spoke with Garland late on Monday and extended the invitation \\u201cwhere they could discuss the nomination and why the Senate will not consider a nominee until the next president takes office.\\u201d The Senate Judiciary Committee is in charge of holding hearings on Supreme Court nominees chosen by the president and deciding whether to recommend full Senate confirmation. Most of the Senate\\u2019s 54 Republicans have indicated opposition to confirming any high-court nominee of Obama\\u2019s, saying the choice should be made by the next president, who would be elected on Nov. 8 and sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. Despite the wall of Republican opposition to Garland, who is considered a moderate federal appeals court judge, Obama and his fellow Democrats continue to push for Senate confirmation this year. Garland already has made several \\u201ccourtesy calls\\u201d to senators, mostly Democrats, and will continue his visits to Capitol Hill this week. If he were to be confirmed, Garland - nominated to fill the vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia - would tilt the Supreme Court to the left for the first time in decades. The race for a replacement for Obama, who is completing his second and final term as president, is in full swing now with billionaire businessman Donald Trump leading two other Republican candidates and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. But it could be weeks or months before the two political parties settle on their respective candidates. A date for the breakfast meeting has not yet been set, Grassley\\u2019s spokeswoman said.\",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The email Donald Trump\\u2019s campaign sent inviting fans to a rally next week looked familiar: \\u201cMeet me in New Jersey!\\u201d it urged. But something was different. \\u201cYou will need to buy a ticket to get into the rally,\\u201d it added. The cost: $200. During the months-long battle for the Republican presidential nomination, rallies staged by Trump, the party\\u2019s likely candidate in the Nov. 8 election, were free and open to anyone with the stamina to withstand half a day\\u2019s wait outside and a heady hour packed into a sports stadium or warehouse. Supporters could buy snacks or hats or T-shirts while they waited, but they never had to pay for admission. The May 19 rally advertised in the email is a fundraiser for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former presidential rival now working for Trump who, according to news reports, needs to retire debt from his own failed campaign. The emailed invitation to supporters said it will be a fundraiser. It was not clear whether Trump will charge for rallies that are not specifically designated as fundraisers.  The New York billionaire has claimed he was self-funding his campaign and did not need donations. He has financed his offensive in the nominating phase of the race for the White House with loans to himself as well as around $12 million in unsolicited donations from fans. Now that Trump is pivoting toward the general election, where conventional estimates put the cost of winning at around $1 billion, things are changing.  The move to charge admission for some appearances was just one harbinger of a new relationship between Trump and his fans, many of whom cited their perception of his financial independence as a major factor behind their support. It will test the loyalty of those who have swelled his rallies to capacity, either transforming huge crowds into cash cows or creating more breathing room in the places where he appears.      When asked whether the format of the Christie fundraiser rally would be repeated in the future, Trump\\u2019s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not comment. \\u201cThis is a fundraiser for Governor Christie,\\u201d she said. Supporters have said Trump\\u2019s about-face on fundraising does not bother them. Susan Kihne, a Mandan, North Dakota resident who snagged a ticket to see Trump speak at a petroleum conference later this month decided the $30 it cost her was worth it. \\u201cHe\\u2019s self-funded up until now, so I don\\u2019t mind supporting him,\\u201d she said. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. senators on Monday sharpened a potential line of attack against Neil Gorsuch\\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court by questioning whether he would be sufficiently independent as a justice in light of President Donald Trump\\u2019s vigorous use of unilateral presidential power including his travel ban. Their comments came after Trump criticized James Robart, the U.S. district court judge who put on hold the Republican president\\u2019s Jan. 27 order temporarily barring entry into the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority nations and halting the U.S. refugee program. Trump called Robart a \\u201cso-called judge\\u201d who made a \\u201cridiculous\\u201d decision. Democrats have expressed worry that Gorsuch, nominated by Trump last week, could act as a rubber stamp for the Republican president\\u2019s policies on a nine-seat Supreme Court poised to revert to a conservative majority.  \\u201cIt\\u2019s a serious concern with a president who attacks the judiciary and seems to not respect the rule of law and the Constitution that you have a really independent justice,\\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, set to meet with Gorsuch on Tuesday, told Reuters. Gorsuch, continuing a series of private meetings with senators ahead of his Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, met on Monday with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the panel\\u2019s top Democrat, at her Senate office. Afterward, she said Gorsuch is \\u201cclearly very smart, caring, and he\\u2019s well thought of in Colorado,\\u201d where he serves as a federal appeals court judge. But Feinstein said she will make up her mind after the hearing about whether or not to support his confirmation. \\u201cWhat we would like to see is an independent judge, and the hearing will determine that,\\u201d Feinstein told Reuters. Gorsuch must be confirmed by the Senate to the lifetime post on the high court. \\u201cIt\\u2019s incumbent upon Judge Gorsuch to make it clear to the American people that he does not believe in \\u2018so-called judges,\\u2019 that he thinks it\\u2019s imperative that the judiciary has to be respected as an independent one-third of our government,\\u201d     said Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year. \\u201cI would look forward to hearing him speak out on that issue,\\u201d Sanders added. Conservative lawyers and Republican senators who are favorable toward Gorsuch cite his record of supporting limited federal powers and his skepticism about courts deferring too much to executive branch interpretations of the law when issuing regulations as signs he would be willing to stand up to Trump. \\u201cI have zero concerns about his independence being compromised,\\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee. Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker, another Republican, said Gorsuch \\u201chas a trail of decisions and publications a mile long that suggest how talented he is, that are instructive as to how he would rule on any number of issues.\\u201d  With four liberals and four conservatives now on the court, Gorsuch\\u2019s confirmation would restore the conservative majority that had existed for decades until the death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch\\u2019s supporters point in particular to a recent case in which Gorsuch criticized a landmark high court ruling known as Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. That 1984 ruling directed judges nationwide to defer to federal agencies\\u2019 interpretation of laws that may be ambiguous. Gorsuch in a concurring opinion called that doctrine the \\u201celephant in the room\\u201d that concentrates federal power \\u201cin a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution.\\u201d If Gorsuch is confirmed to serve on a court that would have five conservatives and four liberals, Democrats have expressed concern about setbacks for their positions on divisive issues such as abortion, gun control, environmental regulation and transgender rights. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2377,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jul 25, 2017\",\n          \"Jul 23, 2016\",\n          \"April 12, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Here is an explanation of how the voting system works: Germany has a mixed-member proportional voting system under which voters cast two ballots: one directly for a candidate in his or her constituency and the second for a party. This second vote determines the distribution of seats in parliament. Merkel s name, for instance, does not appear on the national ballot but only in her constituency in the Stralsund/Ruegen district. She is running there as a direct candidate for her Christian Democrats (CDU) after winning the district seven times in a row since reunification in 1990. German voters sometimes split their ballots to give their preferred coalition extra support: They give their first vote to a direct candidate from one of the two main parties - the CDU and its Bavarian sister party CSU or the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) - and the second vote to a corresponding smaller partner such as the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP), the left-leaning Greens, the far-left Die Linke or the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). The smaller parties have little interest in the first ballot because Germany s 299 constituencies are won on a first past- the-post basis, which normally favors the larger ones. Supporters of smaller parties often give their first vote to one of the two bigger parties, while some CDU/CSU and SPD backers give their second vote to a preferred coalition partner. If the CDU/CSU or SPD wins more direct seats in a state than they would get based on their share of second votes, the Bundestag creates extra  overhang  seats. There are 299 seats in parliament for winners of the direct seats and another 299 seats based on parties  relative strength via the second ballot. The number of overhang seats rose in recent elections because the two main parties, CDU/CSU and the SPD, won all but a handful of the 299 direct seats but had been receiving smaller shares of the second ballots. A new law compensates other parties for overhang seats, thus making it less interesting for the big parties to share support with smaller partners for second votes. In the 2013 election, the CDU/CSU won four extra overhang seats. Through the effect of balance seats, the size of parliament ballooned from 598 to 631 seats. Parties that fail to get more than 5 percent of the nationwide vote or win fewer than three seats by direct election are excluded from parliament. The shares of the other parties are recalculated accordingly. This effect can have major consequences for the process of coalition building. In 2013, the FDP and the AfD came in just below the 5-percent threshold. Since their share of the vote was attributed to the others parties, Merkel s conservatives were nearly able to govern alone with their unadjusted result of only 41.5 percent. In this year s election, six parties are forecast to enter parliament, up from four now. That would leave Germany marked by a more fractured political landscape. The next government will probably need a combined share of at least 47 percent or maybe 48 percent for a stable majority, depending on the voting share of those parties that fail to enter parliament. \",\n          \"The people of Flint, Michigan are suffering from a man-made disaster, and someone should pay the consequences for it.A special investigator is looking into tragedy that has gripped the major Michigan community since 2014 when state officials chose to switch Flint s water supply from Lake Huron to the poisoned river.Ever since, there have been multiple cases of lead poisoning, and ten people have already died from Legionnaires  disease. Kids can now expect to deal with neurological issues as they get older because of the high levels of lead found in their bloodstream.Special Investigator Todd Flood has been brought in along with the former head of the Detroit FBI office and other former law enforcement officials to figure out who knew what and when they knew it. Flood says that manslaughter charges could be on the table. We re here to investigate what possible crimes there are, anything [from] involuntary manslaughter or death that may have happened to some young person or old person because of this poisoning, to misconduct in office,  Flood said.  We take this very seriously. Indeed, he should. The Flint River had been abandoned as a water source for decades by the city precisely because the water was known to be toxic and unsafe for human consumption. This is public knowledge and officials should have known better.But Governor Snyder, who has made it his personal mission to take over city after city and appoint  emergency  managers to do his bidding in an effort to save the state money, has ignored the crisis until very recently when he called it his  Katrina.  Switching to the river was a money-saving scheme that has now backfired into a multi-million dollar catastrophe.And Snyder s emails aren t exactly helping him avoid prison.As the Washington Post reports, emails have been released  showing that Snyder s office knew of the Legionnaires  outbreak more than nine months before the governor announced the problem this January. Snyder s office was even  heavily involved  in the vote the Flint City Council made to make the switch to the river.Perhaps most damning is Congressional testimony by EPA acting water chief, Joel Beauvais, who claimed Snyder and his agencies  ignored federal advice to treat Flint s water for corrosive elements, which are believed to have eroded old lead pipes and contaminated drinking water,  and that  the state delayed for months in telling the public about the health risks. Even Rachel Maddow has shamed Snyder and his administration for their actions and inactions that let the tragedy happen.But Snyder is not the only public official who should be held responsible for poisoning the residents of Flint. Multiple city and state officials ignored the unfolding tragedy for months and even had the nerve to tell residents that the drinking water was perfectly safe even as scientific testing revealed that wasn t the case.As Todd Flood and his team investigate the crisis alongside a federal team conducting a separate investigation of their own, we could end up seeing a line of public officials being handcuffed and fitted for an orange jumpsuit when all is said and done. And that includes Rick Snyder, who frankly should have resigned by now.Ultimately, the buck stops at his desk. He is responsible for protecting the citizens of the state and of overseeing the state health and environmental agencies. It s hard to believe that he knew nothing of this problem for two years.The people of Flint deserve justice. Those who have died because of this deserve justice. The kids who will likely grow up with severe neurological issues deserve justice. And if justice cannot be delivered to Flint, nothing stops public officials from being just as irresponsible in other states.Featured Image: Flickr\",\n          \"The New York Observer, which Ivanka Trump s husband, Jared Kushner, owns, has made its presidential endorsement. Or, more accurately, its presidential non-endorsement. After endorsing Trump during the primaries, his own son-in-law s paper has decided it s not endorsing anyone at all.The Observer s editor-in-chief, Ken Kurson, simply said: Observer is not going to make an endorsement in the general. Oh, ouch. That just hurts, at least for Trump. We re ecstatic. The Observer can t endorse Hillary or they d probably all get fired, and the same thing could happen if they endorsed a third-party candidate. But it seems that they can t, in good conscience, endorse their owner s father-in-law.Wow.Trump hasn t been able to get very many newspaper endorsements in the general   in fact, he s only gotten six endorsements in all, and they re all from small papers with the exception of Sheldon Adelson s Las Vegas Review-Journal. That s it. That s all. Hundreds of newspapers in the country, and Trump garners a whole six endorsements.Compare that to Hillary s dozens of newspaper endorsements, which include conservative papers like the Arizona Republic, which had never endorsed a Democratic candidate in its 126-year history, and the Dallas Morning News, which hadn t endorsed a Democrat for more than 75 years. Other papers with strong histories of endorsing Republicans likewise broke with tradition to endorse Hillary.You know your candidate just sucks horrifically when his own son-in-law s paper can t bring itself to endorse him. Amusingly, the Observer has actually had issues with its coverage of Trump because of Kushner s relationship, with Kurson saying in 2015: If we run something pro-Trump we will automatically be accused of carrying water for him (on account of the relationship to our publisher). If we run something anti-Trump, we will be accused of trying to curry favor with our peers in journalism or worse, intentionally being only a little hard on him so that later we can love him up and point to the earlier softball as proof that we re fair. So they re in an impossible position, really, but their refusal to endorse Trump at all is a blow to his standing as a candidate.Featured image by Brian Blanco via Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jul 13, 2016\",\n          \"November 7, 2017 \",\n          \"Sep 6, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FAKE\",\n          \"REAL\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A spokeswoman for Grassley said that the Republican senator spoke with Garland late on Monday and extended the invitation \\u201cwhere they could discuss the nomination and why the Senate will not consider a nominee until the next president takes office.\\u201d The Senate Judiciary Committee is in charge of holding hearings on Supreme Court nominees chosen by the president and deciding whether to recommend full Senate confirmation. Most of the Senate\\u2019s 54 Republicans have indicated opposition to confirming any high-court nominee of Obama\\u2019s, saying the choice should be made by the next president, who would be elected on Nov. 8 and sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. Despite the wall of Republican opposition to Garland, who is considered a moderate federal appeals court judge, Obama and his fellow Democrats continue to push for Senate confirmation this year. Garland already has made several \\u201ccourtesy calls\\u201d to senators, mostly Democrats, and will continue his visits to Capitol Hill this week. If he were to be confirmed, Garland - nominated to fill the vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia - would tilt the Supreme Court to the left for the first time in decades. The race for a replacement for Obama, who is completing his second and final term as president, is in full swing now with billionaire businessman Donald Trump leading two other Republican candidates and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. But it could be weeks or months before the two political parties settle on their respective candidates. A date for the breakfast meeting has not yet been set, Grassley\\u2019s spokeswoman said.\",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The email Donald Trump\\u2019s campaign sent inviting fans to a rally next week looked familiar: \\u201cMeet me in New Jersey!\\u201d it urged. But something was different. \\u201cYou will need to buy a ticket to get into the rally,\\u201d it added. The cost: $200. During the months-long battle for the Republican presidential nomination, rallies staged by Trump, the party\\u2019s likely candidate in the Nov. 8 election, were free and open to anyone with the stamina to withstand half a day\\u2019s wait outside and a heady hour packed into a sports stadium or warehouse. Supporters could buy snacks or hats or T-shirts while they waited, but they never had to pay for admission. The May 19 rally advertised in the email is a fundraiser for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former presidential rival now working for Trump who, according to news reports, needs to retire debt from his own failed campaign. The emailed invitation to supporters said it will be a fundraiser. It was not clear whether Trump will charge for rallies that are not specifically designated as fundraisers.  The New York billionaire has claimed he was self-funding his campaign and did not need donations. He has financed his offensive in the nominating phase of the race for the White House with loans to himself as well as around $12 million in unsolicited donations from fans. Now that Trump is pivoting toward the general election, where conventional estimates put the cost of winning at around $1 billion, things are changing.  The move to charge admission for some appearances was just one harbinger of a new relationship between Trump and his fans, many of whom cited their perception of his financial independence as a major factor behind their support. It will test the loyalty of those who have swelled his rallies to capacity, either transforming huge crowds into cash cows or creating more breathing room in the places where he appears.      When asked whether the format of the Christie fundraiser rally would be repeated in the future, Trump\\u2019s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not comment. \\u201cThis is a fundraiser for Governor Christie,\\u201d she said. Supporters have said Trump\\u2019s about-face on fundraising does not bother them. Susan Kihne, a Mandan, North Dakota resident who snagged a ticket to see Trump speak at a petroleum conference later this month decided the $30 it cost her was worth it. \\u201cHe\\u2019s self-funded up until now, so I don\\u2019t mind supporting him,\\u201d she said. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. senators on Monday sharpened a potential line of attack against Neil Gorsuch\\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court by questioning whether he would be sufficiently independent as a justice in light of President Donald Trump\\u2019s vigorous use of unilateral presidential power including his travel ban. Their comments came after Trump criticized James Robart, the U.S. district court judge who put on hold the Republican president\\u2019s Jan. 27 order temporarily barring entry into the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority nations and halting the U.S. refugee program. Trump called Robart a \\u201cso-called judge\\u201d who made a \\u201cridiculous\\u201d decision. Democrats have expressed worry that Gorsuch, nominated by Trump last week, could act as a rubber stamp for the Republican president\\u2019s policies on a nine-seat Supreme Court poised to revert to a conservative majority.  \\u201cIt\\u2019s a serious concern with a president who attacks the judiciary and seems to not respect the rule of law and the Constitution that you have a really independent justice,\\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, set to meet with Gorsuch on Tuesday, told Reuters. Gorsuch, continuing a series of private meetings with senators ahead of his Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, met on Monday with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the panel\\u2019s top Democrat, at her Senate office. Afterward, she said Gorsuch is \\u201cclearly very smart, caring, and he\\u2019s well thought of in Colorado,\\u201d where he serves as a federal appeals court judge. But Feinstein said she will make up her mind after the hearing about whether or not to support his confirmation. \\u201cWhat we would like to see is an independent judge, and the hearing will determine that,\\u201d Feinstein told Reuters. Gorsuch must be confirmed by the Senate to the lifetime post on the high court. \\u201cIt\\u2019s incumbent upon Judge Gorsuch to make it clear to the American people that he does not believe in \\u2018so-called judges,\\u2019 that he thinks it\\u2019s imperative that the judiciary has to be respected as an independent one-third of our government,\\u201d     said Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year. \\u201cI would look forward to hearing him speak out on that issue,\\u201d Sanders added. Conservative lawyers and Republican senators who are favorable toward Gorsuch cite his record of supporting limited federal powers and his skepticism about courts deferring too much to executive branch interpretations of the law when issuing regulations as signs he would be willing to stand up to Trump. \\u201cI have zero concerns about his independence being compromised,\\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee. Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker, another Republican, said Gorsuch \\u201chas a trail of decisions and publications a mile long that suggest how talented he is, that are instructive as to how he would rule on any number of issues.\\u201d  With four liberals and four conservatives now on the court, Gorsuch\\u2019s confirmation would restore the conservative majority that had existed for decades until the death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch\\u2019s supporters point in particular to a recent case in which Gorsuch criticized a landmark high court ruling known as Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. That 1984 ruling directed judges nationwide to defer to federal agencies\\u2019 interpretation of laws that may be ambiguous. Gorsuch in a concurring opinion called that doctrine the \\u201celephant in the room\\u201d that concentrates federal power \\u201cin a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution.\\u201d If Gorsuch is confirmed to serve on a court that would have five conservatives and four liberals, Democrats have expressed concern about setbacks for their positions on divisive issues such as abortion, gun control, environmental regulation and transgender rights. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2377,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jul 25, 2017\",\n          \"Jul 23, 2016\",\n          \"April 12, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
